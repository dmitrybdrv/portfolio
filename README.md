The project is implemented using React and TypeScript as its foundation. To simplify development and create a 
visually appealing user interface, the following libraries were utilized:
<ul>
<li>Mantine - a library of components that offers ready-made design elements for rapid development.</li>
<li>Axios - a library for handling HTTP requests, which can be used, for example, to retrieve data about projects.</li>
<li>Nuka Carousel - a component for creating carousels and sliders, utilized for visualizing the project gallery.</li>
<li>React Typing Effect - a component for creating text typing animations, adding interactivity to the page.</li>
</ul>
